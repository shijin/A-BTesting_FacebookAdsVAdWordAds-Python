## Key Analysis

- Platform-wise performance comparison (CTR, CPC, Conversion Rate)
- Time-series trends for each platform
- Monthly trends in total conversions
- Cost efficiency evaluation using Cost per Conversion
- Statistical testing (t-test) for significance in CTR, CPC, and Conversion Rate

## Insights

- Facebook campaigns achieved better overall performance in CTR and Conversion Rate.
- Adwords campaigns incurred higher costs per conversion.
- July 2023 showed a notable spike in conversions, but due to inconsistent campaign timing and lack of objective details, the reason remains unclear.
- Ads appear to be run on an irregular basis, possibly seasonal or based on promotions.
